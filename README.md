# 8Woc Mini Project

### Objective
When people around the world are writing text, there is a need to digitize the written text so that it can be published later on. The program is needed to recognize the letters in the image and identify useful characters and then output a file of the transcribed text from the image.

## Technologies
We're using an Existing API created in **Go**, named [Extract Letters](https://github.com/WycliffeAssociates/ExtractLetters) to recognize the letters within the images.
